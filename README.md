# Huffman Coding Visualizer 📄

Huffman Coding Visualizer is an interactive web application that uses the input from the user to build and visualize a Huffman tree. The Huffman tree can be built with the regular [Huffman Coding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). Additionally, the application shows the binary and encoded binary of the input symbols, displays the amount of memory saved (in bits) with the coding, and visualizes paths from the root of the tree to the character leaves when hovering over characters, bits, or encoded symbols! Test it out: [Live Demo](https://huffman-coding-visualizer-pbxfa.ondigitalocean.app/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this application locally on your computer, you'll need `Git` and `Node.js` (which comes with `npm`) installed on your computer.

### Installing

Then run the following command in the command line and go to the desired directory to store this project:

Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/miladhalabi/huffman-coding.git
    

Go into the repository:

    cd Huffman-Coding-Visualizer

Install all dependencies:

    npm install

Run the app:

    npm start

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The front-end library used to built the user interface
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - Utilized the component library to facilitate the building the front-end
- [D3js](https://d3js.org/) - Javascript library used to visualize the huffman tree
